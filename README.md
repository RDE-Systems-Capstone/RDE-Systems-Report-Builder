**This project is still a work in progress and is not fully functional.**

### About
The goal of this project is "to create a data analytics tool that will allow users to analyze demographic and medical data to discover trends, report outcomes, and study patient populations". 

### Report Builder Page
This part of the project will be where filters and other options are chosen for reports. 

### To-do list:
 - Granularity options for report outputs
 - Input validation (done except for AND/OR in between filters...)
 - Graph outputs (bar graph working)
 - Support for removing filters once added
 - Age filter - between, >=, <= options
 - and more
